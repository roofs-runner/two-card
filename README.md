# Test Project

## Tech stack used 
- React
- TypeScript
- Styled Components
- React testing library

## Project in a nutshell
- To achieve the goal of the task, I've followed traditional React approach. Namely, to manage players I've created `usePlayers` hook.
This hook encapsulates most of the players related logic (like generating/dealing cards or calculating winners).
- Styles are managed by `Styled components`. Styled components are easy to use and offer reach functionality. 
  Moreover, it feels like you are writing React components instead of style sheets.
- Testing of the components is achieved with `React testing library`. 
  Testing library has a rich API, and it is side effects oriented more than any testing frameworks on the market.
